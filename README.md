# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm Leonardo, a software engineer from Brazil.

## Portfolio
Here are some personal projects I've built.

### Card Manager
**Repository:** https://github.com/leonardo-lorenzon/CardManager

This is an application I created to teach unit testing patterns and refactoring techniques that make tests easy to write and extend.

Take a look on the commits of this [MR](https://github.com/leonardo-lorenzon/CardManager/pull/1/commits).
Each commit is a single pattern or technique. You can compare it side-by-side with the previous code.

### Integrator Project
**Repository:** https://github.com/leonardo-lorenzon/projeto-integrador-1-backend

A backend service for the university's Integrated Project discipline.

Here you can check my skills with Docker and Docker Compose. Go ahead, try setting up this application on your machine, it's very easy.
Just make sure you meet the requirements in the _Prerequisites_ section and then run `make build` and `make start`.
That's it, you can now play around with the APIs in localhost swagger.

### Trade in the End
**Repository:** https://github.com/leonardo-lorenzon/trade-in-the-end

A backend service I created to implement a design concept I was reading about.
